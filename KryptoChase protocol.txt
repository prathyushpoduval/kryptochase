Protocol:
Cop:
1st char:
ABCDEF... for cop number
P for powerup

if not powerup
	
	next char:	
	char corresponding to the number of chars in string	
	next N chars:
	the string after doing operations
if powerup
	next  char:
	G: to get i'th digit
	M: MT mind type powerup
	if G:
		next char is the char corresponding to i in ascii
	if M:
		next N chars: 
		the string to check for MT mind style powerup
theif:
1st char:
X
next char:
E if game ends, C if it is normal turn of theif, P if it is powerup response for cops
if E:
	next char: who wins: X if theif, ABCDE for cop number
if P:
	next char : G or M based on the response powerup
	if G:
		next char: the char
	if M:
		next char: number of right ones which are perfectly placed(ascii corresponding char to the number)
		next char: number of right ones which might be incorrectly placed("")
else:
	next char: N if Normal Move, R if revealing move
	if R:
		next N chars: mah string
	if N:
		next char: number(call this i) of moves played in this turn(ascii corresponding char)
		Next 2i chars: which move
			S1: swap 1
			s2: swap 2
			LC: left cyclic
			SC: Right cyclic
			BT: hidden move
